### Important Review Questions and Answers

1. **What is the primary goal of the flashcard exercise in React?**

   - The primary goal is to practice and understand state management in React by building an interactive flashcard application.

2. **What is a flashcard in the context of this exercise?**

   - A flashcard is an element with a question on one side and an answer on the other. Clicking on it flips the card to show the answer.

3. **What is the structure of the data used for the flashcards?**

   - The data is an array of objects, where each object contains an `id`, `question`, and `answer`.

4. **How do you render a list of flashcards in React?**

   - Use JavaScript's `map` function to iterate over the array and render each question inside a `div`.

   ```javascript
   const questions = [
     /* array of question objects */
   ];

   function Flashcards() {
     return (
       <div className='flashcards'>
         {questions.map((question) => (
           <div key={question.id}>
             <p>{question.question}</p>
           </div>
         ))}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

5. **Why do we need to add a unique key to each rendered element in a list?**

   - To ensure each element is uniquely identified, which helps React efficiently update and render elements.

6. **How do you initialize state in a functional React component?**

   - Use the `useState` hook from React to initialize state.

   ```javascript
   const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(null);
   ```

7. **What is the purpose of the `selectedId` state variable?**

   - The `selectedId` state variable keeps track of which flashcard is currently selected or open.

8. **How do you conditionally render content based on the state?**

   - Use conditional rendering inside the `map` function to display the answer if the card is selected, otherwise display the question.

   ```javascript
   {
     questions.map((question) => (
       <div key={question.id}>
         <p>
           {selectedId === question.id ? question.answer : question.question}
         </p>
       </div>
     ));
   }
   ```

9. **How do you apply a CSS class conditionally based on state?**

   - Use a ternary operator to apply a class if the card is selected.

   ```javascript
   <div key={question.id} className={selectedId === question.id ? 'selected' : ''}>
   ```

10. **What is the role of the `handleClick` function in the flashcard component?**

    - The `handleClick` function updates the `selectedId` state when a card is clicked, either opening it or closing it if it was already open.

    ```javascript
    function handleClick(id) {
      setSelectedId((prevId) => (prevId === id ? null : id));
    }
    ```

11. **How do you attach an event handler to an element in React?**

    - Use the `onClick` event to call the `handleClick` function with the appropriate ID.

    ```javascript
    <div key={question.id} onClick={() => handleClick(question.id)}>
    ```

12. **What happens when you click a flashcard in this application?**

    - The flashcard flips to show the answer if it was not already open. If it was open, it closes. Clicking another card will close the first one and open the new one.

13. **Why is it important to reset the `selectedId` to `null` when clicking the same card again?**

    - Resetting the `selectedId` to `null` ensures that clicking the same card again will close it, providing the expected toggle behavior.

14. **What is conditional rendering, and why is it useful?**

    - Conditional rendering is displaying different content based on certain conditions (e.g., state). It is useful for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

15. **What are the three steps of using state in React, as mentioned in the exercise?**

    - The three steps are:
      1. Define the state variable.
      2. Use the state variable in the component.
      3. Update the state based on user interactions or other events.

16. **How do you ensure your styles are applied correctly in a React component?**
    - Include the CSS file and ensure that class names in the JSX match those defined in the CSS file.
