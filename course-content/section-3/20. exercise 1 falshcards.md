## Exercise Overview: Building Flashcards with React State

### Introduction

Understanding state in React can be challenging, especially in different practical scenarios. This exercise aims to deepen your understanding of state management by building a flashcard application. This is a crucial skill for any React developer. Let's dive into the project.

### Project Description

We'll create a flashcard project where each flashcard has a question on one side and an answer on the other. When you click a card, it flips to show the answer. If you click another card, the previous one closes, and the new one opens.

### Starter Code

A starter file is provided with an array of questions. You can fork this CodeSandbox or copy-paste the code into your code editor.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Rendering Flashcards

First, we render the flashcards with only the questions visible.

1. **Data Structure**: An array of objects, each object contains an ID, question, and answer.
2. **Rendering List**: Use JavaScript's `map` function to iterate over the array and render the questions.

```javascript
const questions = [
  /* array of question objects */
];

function Flashcards() {
  return (
    <div className='flashcards'>
      {questions.map((question) => (
        <div key={question.id}>
          <p>{question.question}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

3. **CSS Styling**: Ensure your styles are applied correctly by including the provided `style.css`.

#### 2. Adding State

We need state to track which card is currently selected.

1. **State Initialization**:
   - Define a state variable `selectedId` initialized to `null`.
   - Import the `useState` hook from React.

```javascript
const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(null);
```

2. **Rendering Based on State**:
   - Conditionally render the answer if the card is selected.

```javascript
{
  questions.map((question) => (
    <div key={question.id}>
      <p>{selectedId === question.id ? question.answer : question.question}</p>
    </div>
  ));
}
```

3. **Styling Based on State**:
   - Add a class for the selected card.

```javascript
<div key={question.id} className={selectedId === question.id ? 'selected' : ''}>
```

#### 3. Updating State

Update the state when a card is clicked.

1. **Click Handler**:
   - Define a `handleClick` function to update the state.

```javascript
function handleClick(id) {
  setSelectedId((prevId) => (prevId === id ? null : id));
}
```

2. **Attach Handler to Elements**:
   - Use the `onClick` event to trigger the `handleClick` function.

```javascript
<div key={question.id} onClick={() => handleClick(question.id)}>
```

#### 4. Finalizing the Application

1. **Ensure All Functionality**:
   - When a card is clicked, it should open, showing the answer.
   - Clicking another card closes the first one and opens the new one.
   - Clicking the same card again closes it.

### Key Concepts and Terms

- **State Management**: Tracking and updating the UI based on user interactions.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying content based on state.
- **Event Handling**: Using events like `onClick` to trigger state updates.
- **Unique Keys**: Ensuring each rendered element has a unique key to prevent rendering issues.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively manage state in React to create dynamic and interactive components. This exercise reinforces the critical concepts of state, event handling, and conditional rendering. Understanding these principles will prepare you for more complex state management scenarios in React.
