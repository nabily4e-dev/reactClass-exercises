1. **What are props in React?**
   - Props, short for properties, are inputs to a React component. They allow data to be passed from a parent component to a child component.

2. **How are props typically received in a React component?**
   - Props are typically received as an object, which contains all the props passed to the component. For example:
     ```javascript
     function Order(props) {
       return <div>We are open until {props.closeHour}.</div>;
     }
     ```

3. **What is destructuring in JavaScript, and how can it be used with props in React?**
   - Destructuring is a syntax in JavaScript that allows you to extract properties from objects and bind them to variables. In React, it can be used to directly extract props into variables. For example:
     ```javascript
     function Order({ closeHour }) {
       return <div>We are open until {closeHour}.</div>;
     }
     ```

4. **How do you destructure multiple props in a React component?**
   - You can destructure multiple props by listing them inside curly braces in the function parameter. For example:
     ```javascript
     function Order({ closeHour, openHour }) {
       return <div>We are open from {openHour} to {closeHour}.</div>;
     }
     ```

5. **What is the benefit of destructuring props in React components?**
   - Destructuring props makes the code cleaner and more readable by avoiding repetitive `props.` syntax. It also makes it immediately clear which props a component expects, improving maintainability.

6. **What should you be cautious of when destructuring props in React components?**
   - When destructuring props, ensure you include the correct property names and never forget the curly braces, as this can lead to errors. For example:
     ```javascript
     function Order({ closeHour }) {
       // Correct
     }
     // Incorrect: Missing curly braces
     function Order(closeHour) {
     }
     ```

7. **What happens if you try to destructure a prop that doesn’t exist?**
   - If you try to destructure a prop that doesn’t exist, it will be `undefined`. This will not cause an error but may lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly.

8. **Provide an example of a React component that destructures props and logs them to the console.**
   - Here’s an example of a React component that destructures props and logs them:
     ```javascript
     function Order({ closeHour, openHour }) {
       console.log({ closeHour, openHour });
       return <div>We are open from {openHour} to {closeHour}.</div>;
     }
     ```

9. **What does the following code do, and why is destructuring used?**
    ```javascript
    function Order({ closeHour }) {
      return <div>We are open until {closeHour}.</div>;
    }
    ```
    - This code defines a React component that displays a message using the `closeHour` prop. Destructuring is used to directly extract `closeHour` from the props object, making the code cleaner and easier to read.

10. **Why might it be beneficial to log the props object to the console when developing a React component?**
    - Logging the props object to the console can help you debug and verify which props are being passed to the component, ensuring they are received correctly and have the expected values.
