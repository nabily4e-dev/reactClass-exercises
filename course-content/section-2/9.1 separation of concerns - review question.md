### 9.1 separation of concerns review question

#### Q1: Why did React combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single block of code?

**A1:** React combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single block of code because, in modern web applications, JavaScript is often tightly coupled with HTML and CSS. As JavaScript determines the user interface and content, keeping them together in components makes sense. This co-location allows for better organization and management of code by having data, logic, and appearance in one place.

#### Q2: What was the traditional separation of concerns in web development?

**A2:** The traditional separation of concerns in web development involved keeping HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate files: one file for HTML, one for CSS, and one for JavaScript. This method ensured that each technology handled its specific concern independently.

#### Q3: How did the rise of single-page applications (SPAs) change the way we handle HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?

**A3:** The rise of single-page applications (SPAs) changed the way we handle HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by making JavaScript more responsible for determining the user interface and content. This led to a tighter coupling of these technologies, necessitating a different approach to organizing code, such as combining them in React components.

#### Q4: What is the fundamental reason why React is designed around components?

**A4:** The fundamental reason why React is designed around components is that in modern web applications, logic and UI are tightly coupled. Therefore, having components that contain both the data, logic, and appearance of a part of the UI makes development more efficient and organized.

#### Q5: How does React achieve separation of concerns differently from traditional web development?

**A5:** React achieves separation of concerns differently by focusing on one concern per component instead of one technology per file. Each component encapsulates everything related to a specific piece of the UI, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, thereby providing a modular and cohesive structure.

#### Q6: What does co-location mean in the context of React components?

**A6:** In the context of React components, co-location means placing things that change together as close as possible. For React, this means combining the data, logic, and appearance for a specific UI element into a single component file.

#### Q7: Why did some people initially dislike JSX and the React approach to combining technologies?

**A7:** Some people initially disliked JSX and the React approach because it deviated from the traditional separation of concerns, which kept HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate files. This new paradigm was unfamiliar and seemed to mix concerns, which was contrary to established practices.

#### Q8: How does the React approach provide separation of concerns?

**A8:** The React approach provides separation of concerns by having one concern per component. Each component handles a specific part of the UI, including its data, logic, and appearance. This way, the concerns are still separated, but at the component level rather than the file level.

#### Q9: What are the benefits of having all information about a component in one single place?

**A9:** The benefits of having all information about a component in one single place include easier maintenance, better readability, and more straightforward debugging. It also makes it simpler to manage and update specific parts of the UI, as all relevant code is contained within a single component.

#### Q10: How did the introduction of React and JSX change the way developers approach web development?

**A10:** The introduction of React and JSX changed the way developers approach web development by shifting from a traditional separation of concerns to a component-based architecture. This new approach emphasizes the encapsulation of all aspects of a UI element within a single component, promoting modularity and reusability. It also introduced JSX, which blends JavaScript and HTML, making the development process more intuitive for handling dynamic content.

### Summary

React's approach to combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into components is a response to the needs of modern web applications, where JavaScript often drives the UI. This component-based architecture encapsulates everything related to a specific piece of the UI, offering a new form of separation of concerns that enhances modularity and maintainability. Despite initial resistance, this method has proven effective and widely accepted in the development community.
