### Review Questions

1. **Why is handling events in React important?**
   - Handling events in React is important because it allows components to become interactive and dynamic. By capturing and responding to user actions like clicks and input changes, components can provide a responsive user experience.

2. **What is state in React, and why is it significant?**
   - State in React refers to the data maintained by a component that can change over time. It is important because it allows components to re-render and update the user interface dynamically when the data changes, enabling more interactive applications.

3. **What are controlled elements in React?**
   - Controlled elements in React are form elements whose value is controlled by React state. This means that the form data is managed within the React component, making it easier to handle user input, validate forms, and manage form submissions.

4. **What practical project will be built in this section, and what concepts will it reinforce?**
   - The practical project to be built is a flashcards application. This project will reinforce the concepts of props and state by applying them in a real-world scenario. It will help solidify the understanding of how to manage data and interactions within React components.

5. **What are props in React?**
   - Props, short for properties, are a mechanism for passing data from parent to child components in React. They allow for communication between components and help in rendering dynamic content based on the data received.

6. **How will this section help in building more advanced React applications?**
   - This section will provide foundational skills in making React components interactive and managing state effectively. Mastering these concepts is crucial for developing more complex and responsive applications, as they form the basis for handling user interactions and dynamic data updates.
