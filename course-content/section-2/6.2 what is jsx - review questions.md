### 6.2 What is JSX review qestions

1. **What is JSX in React?**
   
   - JSX is a declarative syntax used to describe the appearance and behavior of React components. It allows combining parts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into one block of code.

2. **Why is JSX a big deal in React?**
   
   - JSX allows developers to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript, making it easier to create and manage components. It is converted to JavaScript by a tool called Babel, enabling browsers to understand and render the components.

3. **How does JSX look and what does it resemble?**
   
   - JSX looks a lot like HTML but is actually an extension of JavaScript that allows embedding HTML-like syntax and JavaScript code.

4. **What tool converts JSX into JavaScript, and why is this conversion necessary?**
   
   - Babel converts JSX into JavaScript. This conversion is necessary because browsers do not understand JSX; they only understand HTML and JavaScript.

5. **What function calls does Babel convert JSX into?**
   
   - Babel converts JSX into `React.createElement` function calls. These function calls create the HTML elements that are rendered on the screen.

6. **Can React be used without JSX? If so, how?**
   
   - Yes, React can be used without JSX by manually writing `React.createElement` function calls. However, this approach is less readable and more cumbersome than using JSX.

7. **What does it mean that JSX is declarative?**
   
   - Declarative means describing what the UI should look like based on the current data in the component, without specifying the step-by-step process to achieve that look.

8. **What is the difference between declarative and imperative programming in the context of UI development?**
   
   - **Imperative Programming**: Involves giving the browser step-by-step instructions on how to manipulate the DOM to update the UI.
   - **Declarative Programming**: Involves describing what the UI should look like at any given time based on the component's current data (props and state), letting React handle the DOM manipulation.

9. **Why is the declarative approach preferred in React?**
   
   - The declarative approach is preferred because it abstracts away DOM manipulation, making code easier to read, write, and maintain. It allows React to efficiently manage the UI updates based on the underlying data.

10. **What role do props and state play in React's declarative approach?**
    
    - Props and state are the data that components use to render the UI. In the declarative approach, the UI is always rendered based on the current props and state, ensuring that the UI is always in sync with the component's data.

### Key Points to Remember

- **JSX**: A syntax extension that combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easier to write and manage React components.
- **Babel**: Converts JSX into `React.createElement` function calls, enabling browsers to understand and render JSX.
- **Declarative Syntax**: JSX allows developers to describe what the UI should look like based on current data, without specifying the steps to achieve that look.
- **Declarative vs. Imperative**: The declarative approach abstracts away DOM manipulation, making code simpler and more maintainable, while the imperative approach involves direct manipulation of the DOM.
- **Props and State**: Central to React's declarative approach, determining how the UI should look at any given time based on the component's data.
