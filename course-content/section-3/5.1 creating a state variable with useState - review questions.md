### Review Questions and Answers

#### 1. **What is the purpose of the `useState` hook in React?**

**Answer:**
The `useState` hook is used to add state variables to functional components in React. It allows the component to manage and update state, which can change over time based on user interactions or other events.

#### 2. **How do you initialize a state variable using `useState`?**

**Answer:**
To initialize a state variable using `useState`, you import `useState` from 'react', then call it with an initial value. It returns an array with two elements: the state variable and a function to update it.
Example:

```javascript
const [step, setStep] = useState(1);
```

#### 3. **What are the three main steps to using state in a React component?**

**Answer:**

1. **Add a new state variable**: Initialize state using `useState`.
2. **Utilize the state variable**: Use the state variable in the component's JSX and logic.
3. **Update the state variable**: Change the state in response to events using the setter function.

#### 4. **How can you prevent a state variable from going out of its valid range?**

**Answer:**
By adding conditions in the event handlers to check the current state value before updating it. For example:

```javascript
function handleNext() {
  if (step < 3) setStep(step + 1);
}

function handlePrevious() {
  if (step > 1) setStep(step - 1);
}
```

#### 5. **What are React hooks and how can you identify them?**

**Answer:**
React hooks are special functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They can be identified by the `use` prefix (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).

#### 6. **What is a critical rule to remember about using hooks in React components?**

**Answer:**
Hooks must be called at the top level of the component function. They cannot be called inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This ensures that hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders.

#### 7. **Why is ESLint important when working with React hooks?**

**Answer:**
ESLint helps enforce best practices and catch errors early in development. It can warn about improper hook usage, such as calling hooks conditionally or inside loops, preventing runtime errors.

#### 8. **What happens when you call the setter function returned by `useState`?**

**Answer:**
Calling the setter function updates the state variable with a new value. React then re-renders the component to reflect the updated state.

#### 9. **Can you manually update a state variable without using the setter function?**

**Answer:**
No, state should only be updated using the setter function returned by `useState`. Manually updating the state variable will not trigger a re-render, leading to inconsistent UI.

#### 10. **Provide an example of how to destructure the array returned by `useState`.**

**Answer:**

```javascript
const [step, setStep] = useState(1);
```

Here, `step` is the state variable and `setStep` is the function to update it.
