### 11.1 passing and receiving props review questions

### Questions and Answers

**Q1: What is the purpose of props in React?**

- **A1:** Props are used to pass data between components, particularly from parent components to child components. They act as a communication channel between parent and child components.

**Q2: How do you define and pass props in a React component?**

- **A2:** Props are defined and passed in two steps:
  
  1. **Passing Props:** In the parent component, props are passed to the child component as attributes, similar to HTML attributes. For example:
     
     ```jsx
     <PizzaComponent name="Pizza Spinazzi" ingredients="Tomato, Spinach" photo="spinazzi.jpg" price="10" />
     ```
  
  2. **Receiving Props:** In the child component, props are received as a parameter and can be accessed as properties of the `props` object. For example:
     
     ```jsx
     function PizzaComponent(props) {
       console.log(props);
       return (
         <div>
           <img src={props.photo} alt={props.name} />
           <h2>{props.name}</h2>
           <p>{props.ingredients}</p>
           <span>{props.price}</span>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

**Q3: How can you customize multiple instances of a component using props?**

- **A3:** By passing different prop values to each instance of the component, you can customize each one uniquely. For example:
  
  ```jsx
  <PizzaComponent name="Pizza Spinazzi" ingredients="Tomato, Spinach" photo="spinazzi.jpg" price="10" />
  <PizzaComponent name="Pizza Funghi" ingredients="Tomato, Mushrooms" photo="funghi.jpg" price="12" />
  ```

**Q4: What types of values can be passed as props?**

- **A4:** Props can be strings, numbers, arrays, objects, or even other React components. They are not limited to just strings.

**Q5: How do you ensure a prop is treated as a number and not a string?**

- **A5:** To ensure a prop is treated as a number, you should pass it using JavaScript expression syntax. For example:
  
  ```jsx
  <PizzaComponent price={10} />
  ```

**Q6: What happens if you try to add a number to a string prop directly in JSX?**

- **A6:** If you try to add a number to a string prop directly in JSX, JavaScript will concatenate the number to the string rather than performing arithmetic addition. For example:
  
  ```jsx
  // Incorrect: This will result in a string concatenation
  <span>{props.price + 3}</span> // Output: "103"
  
  // Correct: Ensure price is a number
  <span>{Number(props.price) + 3}</span> // Output: 13
  ```

**Q7: How do you dynamically display props within JSX?**

- **A7:** To dynamically display props within JSX, you use curly braces `{}` to enter JavaScript mode. For example:
  
  ```jsx
  <img src={props.photo} alt={props.name} />
  <h2>{props.name}</h2>
  <p>{props.ingredients}</p>
  <span>{props.price}</span>
  ```

**Q8: Why is it important to correctly format props and understand their data types in React?**

- **A8:** Correctly formatting props and understanding their data types is crucial because it ensures that the data is used as intended within the component. Misunderstanding data types can lead to bugs, such as treating numbers as strings and vice versa.

**Q9: Can props be used to pass functions or other components in React?**

- **A9:** Yes, props can be used to pass functions, arrays, objects, or even other React components. This makes props a very powerful feature in React for creating flexible and reusable components.
