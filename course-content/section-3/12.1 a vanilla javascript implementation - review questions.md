### **Review Questions and Answers**

#### **1. What is the main difference between vanilla JavaScript and React in terms of state management?**

**Q**: How does state management differ between vanilla JavaScript and React?
**A**: In vanilla JavaScript, state is managed using variables and the DOM is manually updated to reflect state changes. In React, state is managed using the `useState` hook, and React automatically updates the UI when the state changes.

#### **2. How do you handle DOM manipulation in vanilla JavaScript compared to React?**

**Q**: What is the difference in handling DOM manipulation between vanilla JavaScript and React?
**A**: In vanilla JavaScript, you manually select DOM elements and update them directly. In React, you describe the UI declaratively using JSX, and React handles the DOM updates based on state changes.

#### **3. What are the benefits of using React components?**

**Q**: Why are React components beneficial for building web applications?
**A**: React components promote reusability, encapsulate both logic and UI, and manage their own state independently. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code.

#### **4. How do event handlers in vanilla JavaScript differ from those in React?**

**Q**: How do you handle event listeners and state updates in vanilla JavaScript compared to React?
**A**: In vanilla JavaScript, you add event listeners to DOM elements and manually update the state and DOM. In React, you define event handlers that update the state, and React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the changes.

#### **5. What is the role of the `useState` hook in React?**

**Q**: What does the `useState` hook do in a React component?
**A**: The `useState` hook is used to declare state variables in functional components. It provides a way to update the state and triggers a re-render of the component when the state changes.

#### **6. What is the difference between imperative and declarative code?**

**Q**: What is the difference between imperative and declarative approaches in programming?
**A**: Imperative code describes how to perform tasks step-by-step, explicitly defining each operation. Declarative code describes what the desired outcome is without specifying the exact steps to achieve it. React uses a declarative approach through JSX.

#### **7. How does React ensure that the UI stays in sync with the state?**

**Q**: How does React automatically keep the UI in sync with the state?
**A**: React automatically updates the UI by re-rendering components whenever the state changes. The declarative nature of JSX ensures that the UI reflects the current state without manual DOM manipulation.

#### **8. What tool can you use to inspect the component tree and state in a React application?**

**Q**: How can you inspect the component tree and state in a React application?
**A**: You can use React Dev Tools, a browser extension that allows you to inspect the React component tree and the state of each component.

#### **9. How does React handle reusability and isolated state in components?**

**Q**: How does React manage reusability and isolated state in components?
**A**: React components can be reused in different parts of an application, and each instance of a component manages its own state independently. This ensures that changes in one instance do not affect others.

#### **10. What are the benefits of using JSX in React?**

**Q**: What are the advantages of using JSX in React applications?
**A**: JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript, making the code more readable and declarative. It simplifies the process of creating and updating the UI by describing what the UI should look like based on the current state.
