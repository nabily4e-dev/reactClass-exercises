1. **Why might you want to extract parts of JSX into a new component?**
   - Extracting parts of JSX into a new component can help keep your code organized and maintainable, especially when a component becomes too large or complex.

2. **How do you create a new component in React?**
   - To create a new component in React, define a function that returns the desired JSX. For example:
     ```javascript
     function Order() {
       return (
         // JSX goes here
       );
     }
     ```

3. **How do you use the newly created component in another component?**
   - You can use the new component just like any other JSX element by including it within the parent component's JSX. For example:
     ```javascript
     function Footer() {
       return (
         <div>
           {/* Other JSX */}
           <Order />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

4. **What are props, and how do you pass them to a component?**
   - Props are inputs to a React component that allow data to be passed from a parent component to a child component. You pass props by adding attributes to the child component when it's used in the parent component. For example:
     ```javascript
     <Order closeHour={closeHour} />
     ```

5. **How do you access props in a React component?**
   - Props can be accessed in a React component by including `props` as a parameter in the component function and then using `props.propName` to access the specific prop. For example:
     ```javascript
     function Order(props) {
       return (
         <div>We are open until {props.closeHour}.</div>
       );
     }
     ```

6. **What should you do if a new component needs data that was only available in the parent component?**
   - If a new component needs data from the parent component, pass that data as a prop to the new component. For example:
     ```javascript
     function Footer() {
       const closeHour = 22;
       return <Order closeHour={closeHour} />;
     }
     ```

7. **How do you ensure that the names of props are meaningful and clear?**
   - While naming props, use descriptive names that clearly indicate what the data represents. This makes the code easier to read and understand. For example:
     ```javascript
     <Order closeHour={closeHour} />
     ```

8. **What common issue might you encounter if you do not correctly match the prop names in the parent and child components?**
   - If the prop names do not match between the parent and child components, the child component will not receive the data correctly, leading to errors or incorrect rendering.

9. **Provide an example of extracting a piece of JSX that depends on a value from the parent component into a new component.**
   - Hereâ€™s an example where a piece of JSX that depends on the `closeHour` value is extracted into a new `Order` component:
     ```javascript
     function Footer({ closeHour }) {
       return (
         <div>
           <Order closeHour={closeHour} />
         </div>
       );
     }

     function Order({ closeHour }) {
       return <div>We are open until {closeHour}.</div>;
     }
     ```

10. **What is the benefit of drawing out the entire component tree for a project?**
    - Drawing out the entire component tree helps you visualize and understand the structure of your application, how components are nested, and how data flows between them. This can make it easier to manage and debug your code.
