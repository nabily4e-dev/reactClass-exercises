### 4. components as building blocks review questions



1. **What are React components and why are they fundamental?**
   
   - React components are the building blocks of any user interface in React. React applications are entirely made out of components, which are pieces of the UI that contain their own data, JavaScript logic, and appearance.

2. **How does React render components onto a web page?**
   
   - React renders a view for each component, and all these views together make up the user interface (UI). React's main job is to take components and draw them onto a web page.

3. **What key property makes components effective in building user interfaces?**
   
   - Each component has its own data, JavaScript logic, and appearance, which makes them modular and reusable for building complex UIs.

4. **How do you build complex UIs in React?**
   
   - Complex UIs are built by creating multiple components and combining them like Lego pieces. Components can be nested inside other components, forming a hierarchy.

5. **What is the significance of nesting components in React?**
   
   - Nesting components is crucial because it allows you to build a hierarchy of components, where one component (the parent) can contain other components (the children). This structure helps organize and manage the UI efficiently.

6. **What is component reusability and why is it important?**
   
   - Component reusability means creating a component once and using it multiple times throughout the UI. This is important for reducing duplication and maintaining consistency in the UI.

7. **How can different data be passed into different instances of the same component?**
   
   - Different data can be passed into different instances of the same component using props. Props allow components to receive data and parameters from their parent components.

8. **What is a component tree and what does it show?**
   
   - A component tree is a visual representation of the hierarchy of components in a React application. It shows how components are nested inside each other and their parent-child relationships.

9. **What are parent and child components in React?**
   
   - A parent component is a component that contains other components (child components). A child component is a component that is nested inside another component (the parent). These terms help describe the relationships between components in the hierarchy.

10. **Why is understanding the component tree important?**
    
    - Understanding the component tree is important because it helps visualize and comprehend the relationships and nesting of components, making it easier to manage and organize the UI.

### Key Points to Remember

- **Components as Building Blocks**: Components are the fundamental units of a React application, each with its own data, logic, and appearance.
- **Rendering Components**: React renders components to form the UI, handling views for each component.
- **Nesting and Reusability**: Components can be nested inside each other, and reusability allows components to be used multiple times with different data.
- **Props**: Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components.
- **Component Tree**: The component tree illustrates the hierarchical relationships between components, aiding in understanding and managing the UI structure.
- **Parent and Child Components**: These terms describe the relationships between components, where parent components contain child components.
