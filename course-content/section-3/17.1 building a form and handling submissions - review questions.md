### Review Questions and Answers

1. **Why are forms important in web applications?**

   - Forms are fundamental in web applications because they enable user interaction, such as inputting and submitting data.

2. **What HTML elements are used to create a basic form in React?**

   - A basic form in React uses the `<form>`, `<select>`, `<input>`, and `<button>` elements.

3. **How can you dynamically create options in a `<select>` element using JavaScript in React?**

   - Use `Array.from({ length: 20 }, (_, index) => index + 1)` to create an array of numbers from 1 to 20 and then use the `map()` method to generate `<option>` elements.

4. **What is the purpose of the `key` attribute in React when creating a list of elements?**

   - The `key` attribute provides a unique identifier for each element in a list, which helps React efficiently update and render elements.

5. **How do you prevent a form from reloading the page upon submission in React?**

   - Use `event.preventDefault()` within the submit event handler to prevent the default form submission behavior that causes a page reload.

6. **What is the difference between handling form submission with `onSubmit` versus `onClick` in React?**

   - `onSubmit` handles form submissions both when the submit button is clicked and when the Enter key is pressed, while `onClick` only handles button clicks.

7. **What is a synthetic event in React?**

   - A synthetic event is Reactâ€™s wrapper around the browser's native event, ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers.

8. **How can you access form data from the event object in React?**

   - Form data can be accessed via the event object's `target` property, which contains the form elements and their values.

9. **Why is the `event` parameter important in the `handleSubmit` function?**

   - The `event` parameter contains information about the form submission event, including the `preventDefault` method to stop the default behavior and the `target` property to access form data.

10. **What method is typically used in React to manage form data instead of directly accessing the event object?**
    - Controlled components are typically used in React to manage form data, where form element values are controlled by React state.
