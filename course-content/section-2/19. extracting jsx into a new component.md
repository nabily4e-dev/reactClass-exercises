## Understanding React Components and Props

### Key Concepts

1. **Components**: In React, components are the building blocks of the application. They encapsulate a part of the user interface (UI) and can be reused throughout the application.

2. **Props**: Props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They allow components to be dynamic and configurable.

### Steps to Refactor a Component

Let's break down the example provided step by step to understand how to extract parts of a component into a new one and pass props to it.

### Initial Footer Component

Imagine we have a `Footer` component with some JSX code that we want to simplify by extracting a part of it into a new component:

```jsx
function Footer() {
  const closeHour = 22; // Example value

  return (
    <footer>
      {/* Some other footer content */}
      <div>
        {closeHour < 12 ? 'Closed' : `Open until ${closeHour}:00`}
      </div>
    </footer>
  );
}
```

### Step 1: Extracting JSX into a New Component

We decide that the part of the JSX that handles displaying the closing hour should be moved into its own component called `Order`.

1. **Cut the JSX**: Remove the JSX that you want to move to the new component.
2. **Create the New Component**: Define a new function component and return the removed JSX from it.

```jsx
function Order() {
  return (
    <div>
      {closeHour < 12 ? 'Closed' : `Open until ${closeHour}:00`}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Using the New Component in the Parent Component

Replace the original JSX with the new `Order` component in the `Footer` component.

```jsx
function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer>
      {/* Some other footer content */}
      <Order />
    </footer>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Passing Props

The `Order` component needs access to the `closeHour` value from the `Footer` component. To do this, we use props:

1. **Pass the Prop**: Add the prop to the `Order` component in the `Footer` component.

```jsx
function Footer() {
  const closeHour = 22;

  return (
    <footer>
      {/* Some other footer content */}
      <Order closeHour={closeHour} />
    </footer>
  );
}
```

2. **Receive the Prop**: Modify the `Order` component to receive props and use the passed prop value.

```jsx
function Order(props) {
  const { closeHour } = props; // Destructuring props

  return (
    <div>
      {closeHour < 12 ? 'Closed' : `Open until ${closeHour}:00`}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Step 4: Correcting and Validating

Ensure all references are correct and test the component to confirm it works as expected. In this case, fixing the misnamed props:

```jsx
function Footer() {
  const closeHour = 22;

  return (
    <footer>
      {/* Some other footer content */}
      <Order closeHour={closeHour} />
    </footer>
  );
}

function Order({ closeHour }) { // Using destructuring directly
  return (
    <div>
      {closeHour < 12 ? 'Closed' : `Open until ${closeHour}:00`}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Common Use Cases for Props

1. **Configuration**: Allowing parent components to configure child components with different data or behavior.
2. **Data Passing**: Passing data down the component tree from parent to child components.
3. **Event Handling**: Passing functions from parent to child components to handle events in the parent context.

### Drawing Component Tree

Drawing the component tree helps in visualizing the structure and relationships between components:

1. **Root Component**: Start from the top-level component.
2. **Children Components**: Draw lines connecting parent components to their direct children.
3. **Props Mapping**: Indicate what props are passed between components.

### Example Component Tree

For the `Footer` and `Order` components, the tree would look like this:

```
Footer
  ├── Other footer content
  └── Order
       └── closeHour
```

### Conclusion

Extracting parts of a component into new components and using props effectively is a fundamental practice in React development. It helps in keeping components manageable, reusable, and easy to understand.
