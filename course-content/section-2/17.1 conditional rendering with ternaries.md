1. **What is the ternary operator and how is it structured?**
   
   - The ternary operator is a shorthand for the `if-else` statement in JavaScript, consisting of three parts: a condition, a result if the condition is true, and a result if the condition is false. The structure is:
     
     ```javascript
     condition ? resultIfTrue : resultIfFalse
     ```

2. **How can you use the ternary operator for conditional rendering in React?**
   
   - You can use the ternary operator inside JSX to render different components or elements based on a condition. For example:
     
     ```javascript
     {isOpen ? <div>We're open until {closeHour}. Come visit us or order online!</div> : null}
     ```

3. **What is the advantage of using the ternary operator over the `&&` operator for conditional rendering?**
   
   - The ternary operator allows you to display an alternative output if the condition is false, providing more flexibility compared to the `&&` operator, which only renders something if the condition is true.

4. **Why can't you use an `if-else` statement directly inside JSX?**
   
   - JSX requires expressions that produce values, and an `if-else` statement does not produce a value. Instead, the ternary operator can be used because it returns a value based on the condition.

5. **Provide an example of using the ternary operator to display an alternative message if a condition is not met.**
   
   - Here is an example where a message is displayed if there are no pizzas:
     
     ```javascript
     {numPizzas > 0 ? <PizzaList pizzas={pizzas} /> : <div>We're still working on our menu. Please come back later.</div>}
     ```

6. **What does the following code do using the ternary operator?**
   
   ```javascript
   {isOpen ? <div>We're open until {closeHour}. Come visit us or order online!</div> : <div>We're happy to welcome you between {openHour} and {closeHour}.</div>}
   ```
   
   - This code checks if `isOpen` is true. If it is, it renders a message indicating the restaurant is open and its closing hour. If `isOpen` is false, it renders a message with the restaurant's opening hours.

7. **How does the ternary operator help in producing a value in JSX?**
   
   - The ternary operator helps produce a value in JSX by evaluating a condition and returning one of two possible values based on whether the condition is true or false, making it suitable for inline conditional rendering.

8. **Why might you prefer using the ternary operator over the `&&` operator in certain situations?**
   
   - You might prefer the ternary operator because it allows for the display of an alternative message or element when the condition is false, rather than displaying nothing at all.

9. **Can you use the ternary operator inside JSX for complex conditions? Provide an example.**
   
   - Yes, you can use the ternary operator for complex conditions inside JSX. For example:
     
     ```javascript
     {isOpen ? (
       <div>We're open until {closeHour}. Come visit us or order online!</div>
     ) : (
       <div>We're happy to welcome you between {openHour} and {closeHour}.</div>
     )}
     ```

10. **What should you do if you need to render multiple elements conditionally using the ternary operator?**
    
    - If you need to render multiple elements conditionally, wrap them in a container element (like a `<div>` or a fragment `<>...</>`) within the ternary operator. For example:
      
      ```javascript
      {numPizzas > 0 ? (
        <ul>{pizzas.map(pizza => <PizzaComponent key={pizza.name} pizza={pizza} />)}</ul>
      ) : (
        <div>No pizzas available. Please check back later.</div>
      )}
      ```
