### Review Questions and Answers

**Question 1: What is the main difference between React and vanilla JavaScript in handling HTML and JavaScript?**

- **Answer:** In React, JavaScript is in charge of everything, including rendering HTML. JSX allows writing HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript. In vanilla JavaScript, HTML is still in charge, and JavaScript is included within the HTML file to manipulate it.

**Question 2: How does React keep the user interface in sync with the state?**

- **Answer:** React automatically keeps the user interface in sync with the state. When the state changes, React updates the UI to reflect these changes without the need for manual DOM manipulation.

**Question 3: What manual tasks are required in vanilla JavaScript that React handles automatically?**

- **Answer:** In vanilla JavaScript, you need to manually select DOM elements, update them when the state changes, and attach event listeners. React handles these tasks automatically, reducing the amount of manual code required.

**Question 4: What happens when you update the state in a React application compared to a vanilla JavaScript application?**

- **Answer:** In React, updating the state automatically updates the user interface. In vanilla JavaScript, updating state variables alone does not change the UI; you must manually update the DOM elements to reflect the new state.

**Question 5: Why might React be preferred over vanilla JavaScript for larger applications?**

- **Answer:** As applications grow in size, managing state and keeping the UI in sync with the state manually in vanilla JavaScript becomes increasingly complex and error-prone. React simplifies this by automatically handling these tasks, making it easier to manage larger applications.

**Question 6: What is the purpose of using JSX in React?**

- **Answer:** JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax directly within JavaScript, making it easier to visualize the structure of the UI and maintain a clean separation between logic and presentation.

**Question 7: In the provided comparison, what are the two pieces of state in both the React and vanilla JavaScript implementations?**

- **Answer:** The two pieces of state are `count` (which starts at zero) and `advice`.

**Question 8: How do you attach an event listener in React compared to vanilla JavaScript?**

- **Answer:** In React, you attach event listeners using attributes like `onClick` directly in the JSX. In vanilla JavaScript, you manually select the DOM element and use `addEventListener` to attach the event listener.

**Question 9: What is the fundamental shift in building front-end applications when using React compared to vanilla JavaScript?**

- **Answer:** The fundamental shift is that React abstracts away the manual DOM manipulation by keeping the UI automatically in sync with the state. This shift simplifies the development process, especially for larger applications, by reducing the amount of manual code and potential for errors.
