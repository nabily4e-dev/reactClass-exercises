### Review Questions and Answers

1. **What is the purpose of transforming the `div` element into a `ul` element?**

   - The purpose is to use semantic HTML. An unordered list (`ul`) is more appropriate for rendering lists of items, improving accessibility and SEO.

2. **How do we use the `map` method to render a list in React?**

   - The `map` method is used to iterate over an array of items and return a new array of React components. Each item in the array is mapped to a corresponding component.

3. **What are the properties of the item objects in the initial data array?**

   - Each item object contains the properties: `id`, `description`, `quantity`, and `packed`.

4. **How do you pass data to a child component in React?**

   - Data is passed to a child component using props. For example, `<Item key={item.id} item={item} />` passes the entire item object as a prop named `item`.

5. **What is destructuring, and how is it used in the `Item` component?**

   - Destructuring is a syntax for unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. In the `Item` component, it is used to directly extract the `item` prop: `const Item = ({ item }) =>`.

6. **Why is conditional styling important, and how is it implemented in this example?**

   - Conditional styling is important for dynamically changing the appearance of components based on their state. In this example, it is implemented using a ternary operator to apply a strikethrough style if the item is packed: `style={item.packed ? { textDecoration: 'line-through' } : {}}`.

7. **What is the purpose of using semantic HTML in React applications?**

   - Semantic HTML improves the accessibility and readability of the application, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand the structure and content of the webpage.

8. **Explain the use of the ternary operator in applying styles conditionally.**

   - The ternary operator checks a condition and returns one value if the condition is true and another value if it is false. In this case, it checks if `item.packed` is true and applies the `textDecoration: 'line-through'` style; otherwise, it applies an empty style object: `style={item.packed ? { textDecoration: 'line-through' } : {}}`.

9. **How is a delete button added to each item, and what placeholder is used initially?**

   - A delete button is added by including a `<button>` element with an emoji (‚ùå) as a placeholder. This button currently does not have an event handler attached.

10. **Why is it important to use the `key` prop when rendering lists in React?**
    - The `key` prop is important for helping React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be unique and stable identifiers for each item in the list, such as `item.id`.
