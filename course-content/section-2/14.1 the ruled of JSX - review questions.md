1. **What is JSX and how is it similar to HTML?**
   - JSX works essentially just like HTML with a very similar syntax. 

2. **How do we enter JavaScript mode in JSX?**
   - By using curly braces `{}` anywhere in the markup where a value like text or an attribute is expected.

3. **What can be placed inside the curly braces in JSX?**
   - Any JavaScript expression that produces a value. This includes referencing variables, creating arrays or objects, looping over arrays using the `map` method, and using operators like the ternary operator.

4. **What is not allowed inside the curly braces in JSX?**
   - Statements such as `if else` statements, `for` loops, `switch` statements, or any other control flow statements.

5. **What is the result of a piece of JSX code?**
   - A piece of JSX produces a JavaScript expression.

6. **What are the implications of JSX producing a JavaScript expression?**
   - We can place other pieces of JSX inside the curly braces.
   - We can write JSX anywhere inside a component, such as assigning it to a variable, using it inside an `if else` statement, or passing it into functions.

7. **How many root elements can a piece of JSX have?**
   - Only one root element (one parent element). If more than one element is needed, use a React fragment.

8. **Is JSX identical to HTML?**
   - No, there are some differences, but they are straightforward and best explored by using code. These differences are better understood in practice as you write more code.
