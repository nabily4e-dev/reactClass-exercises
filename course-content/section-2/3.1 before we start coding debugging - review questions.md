3. before we start coding debugging

1. **How do you stop and restart a React application in the terminal?**
   
   - To stop the application, use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. To restart it, run `npm start`.

2. **What is a common method to force a browser to update a React application?**
   
   - Perform a hard reload in the browser by clicking the reload button.

3. **Why is it beneficial to keep the terminal and browser dev tools open while developing a React application?**
   
   - Keeping the terminal open helps you monitor if the app is running and displays any terminal errors. Keeping the browser dev tools open allows you to see console errors and inspect elements, helping to identify issues quickly.

4. **How does Create React App help in displaying error messages?**
   
   - Create React App displays error messages as an overlay on the application window, providing immediate feedback on errors.

5. **What should you do if you encounter an error message you do not understand?**
   
   - Copy the error message and search for it on Google or StackOverflow, as many developers have likely encountered and solved the same issue.

6. **What is the significance of ESLint in a React project?**
   
   - ESLint helps identify potential issues in your code by providing warnings and errors for problematic code patterns, ensuring code quality and consistency.

7. **What is a common issue related to ESLint and how can you resolve it?**
   
   - Sometimes ESLint may stop working. Check the output tab in VS Code for ESLint-related errors and try to resolve them by following the displayed messages.

8. **What should you do if your code looks correct but is still not working?**
   
   - Compare your code with the final project code provided in the course materials to identify and fix any discrepancies or bugs.

9. **How can you identify which version of React you are using?**
   
   - Check the `dependencies` array in your `package.json` file. For example, `"react": "18.2.0"` indicates that you are using React version 18.2.

### Key Points to Remember

- **Running the App**: Always ensure your app is running using `npm start`. If issues persist, stop and restart the app.
- **Browser Reload**: Use hard reload in the browser to force updates.
- **Dev Tools and Terminal**: Keep both open to monitor errors and ensure the app is running.
- **Error Handling**: Utilize error overlays, Google, and StackOverflow for troubleshooting.
- **ESLint**: Regularly check for ESLint warnings and errors to maintain code quality.
- **Code Comparison**: Compare your code with provided final code to debug issues.
- **React Version**: Know how to check your React version in `package.json`.
