## Building the Layout: A Comprehensive Breakdown

### Introduction

In this lesson, we'll construct the static layout for our application. This process involves setting up our project with the necessary files and structuring the layout using React components. We'll go through each step systematically, ensuring a clear understanding of the procedure.

### Initial Setup

1. **Starter Files**: Begin by obtaining the starter CSS file. This file will provide the basic styles for our application, saving us from writing custom styles initially. Place this CSS file in the `src` directory, replacing any existing file with the same name.

2. **Clean Up**: Remove unnecessary files to streamline our project. Keep only `App.js`, `Index.js`, and `index.css`.

3. **VS Code Setup**: Open the project in Visual Studio Code by dragging and dropping the project folder onto the VS Code icon.

### Project Structure

4. **File Preparation**: Clean up `App.js` by removing imports and code related to files we've deleted. This ensures there are no errors from missing files.

5. **Starting from Scratch**: Although you can delete everything and start from scratch to practice setting up a React app, we'll leave some boilerplate code to simulate real-world scenarios where you don't always start from scratch.

### Component Creation

6. **Parent Component**:

   - Create a functional component for the main app. This component will act as the parent for all other components.
   - Name this component `App`.

7. **Sub-components**:
   - **Logo Component**: Create a `Logo` component. This will contain a primary heading with the text "Far Away" and an emoji.
   - **Packing List Component**: Create a `PackingList` component as a placeholder for the list items.
   - **Stats Component**: Create a `Stats` component as a footer element, which will display statistics like the number of items packed.

### Adding Emojis

8. **Emojis**: To add emojis:
   - On Mac: Use `Control + Command + Spacebar`.
   - On Windows: Use `Windows Key + Period`.
   - Example: Add a palm tree emoji ðŸŒ´ in the `Logo` component.

### Scaffolding the Layout

9. **Component Setup**:

   - For the `Logo` component, use a primary heading with some emoji.
   - For the `PackingList` component, add a `div` with the class `ad-form` and a placeholder text.
   - For the `Stats` component, use a footer element with placeholder text for stats.

10. **CSS Exploration**: Feel free to explore the CSS file to understand the styles applied to these classes.

### Integrating Components

11. **App Component Integration**:
    - Integrate all the sub-components (`Logo`, `PackingList`, `Stats`) into the `App` component.
    - Use a `div` with the class `app` to contain these components.
    - Order them as defined in the code: `Logo`, `PackingList`, and `Stats`.

### File Organization

12. **Future Considerations**: In larger, more complex applications, each component will be placed in its own file (e.g., `Logo.js`, `PackingList.js`, `Stats.js`). For now, to avoid confusion, keep them in the same file.

### Finalizing the Layout

13. **Completing Integration**:
    - Ensure all components are included in the `App` component without any errors.
    - Resolve any ESLint warnings or errors, such as unused variables.

### Running the Application

14. **Starting the App**:

    - Open the integrated terminal in VS Code.
    - Ensure you're in the correct folder and run `npm start`.
    - Verify that the layout renders correctly.

15. **Troubleshooting**:
    - If the layout doesn't appear as expected, check for any missing classes or components.
    - For example, ensure the `footer` in the `Stats` component has the class `stats`.

### Next Steps

16. **Rendering Static Items**: In the next lecture, we'll focus on rendering static items in the UI. We'll use an array to display these items, laying the groundwork for dynamically adding new items later.

### Summary

By following these steps, we've successfully built the static layout for our application. This structured approach ensures a clear understanding of each component's role and how they integrate to form the complete application. Remember, practice is key, so feel free to experiment and make this project your own.
