1. **How do you conditionally set text content inside an element in React?**
   
   - You can conditionally set text content inside an element using the ternary operator within JSX. For example:
     
     ```javascript
     <span>{pizza.soldOut ? 'SOLD OUT' : pizza.price}</span>
     ```

2. **Why is it better to conditionally set the content of an element rather than the entire element itself?**
   
   - It is often cleaner and more efficient to conditionally set the content of an element rather than the entire element because it avoids unnecessary creation of new elements and keeps the code simpler and more readable.

3. **Provide an example of conditionally setting the content of a `span` element in React.**
   
   - Here’s an example of conditionally setting the content of a `span` element:
     
     ```javascript
     <span>{pizza.soldOut ? 'SOLD OUT' : `$${pizza.price}`}</span>
     ```

4. **How do you conditionally add a class name to an element in React?**
   
   - You can conditionally add a class name using template literals and the ternary operator. For example:
     
     ```javascript
     <div className={`pizza ${pizza.soldOut ? 'sold-out' : ''}`}>
       {/* other content */}
     </div>
     ```

5. **Explain the purpose of using template literals for conditionally setting class names.**
   
   - Template literals allow you to embed expressions inside a string, making it easier to conditionally include parts of the string (like class names) based on the result of JavaScript expressions.

6. **Provide an example of using a template literal to conditionally add a class name in React.**
   
   - Here’s an example of using a template literal to conditionally add a class name:
     
     ```javascript
     <div className={`pizza ${pizza.soldOut ? 'sold-out' : ''}`}>
       {/* other content */}
     </div>
     ```

7. **What happens if the condition in the ternary operator is false when setting a class name?**
   
   - If the condition in the ternary operator is false, the class name for the false case (usually an empty string) will be added, effectively not adding any additional class to the element.

8. **How does React's declarative nature make it easier to conditionally set text and class names compared to vanilla JavaScript?**
   
   - React’s declarative nature allows you to define how the UI should look based on the state or props directly in the render method, making it easier and more intuitive to conditionally set text and class names without manually manipulating the DOM as in vanilla JavaScript.

9. **What is the difference between setting a class name conditionally in React and using the `classList` property in vanilla JavaScript?**
   
   - In React, you conditionally set class names directly within JSX using expressions, making the code more declarative and easier to understand. In vanilla JavaScript, you would need to use the `classList` property and manipulate classes imperatively, which can be more cumbersome and error-prone.

10. **How do you ensure that conditional class names do not disrupt the existing class structure?**
    
    - By using template literals and including a default class along with the conditional class, you ensure the existing class structure remains intact. For example:
      
      ```javascript
      <div className={`pizza ${pizza.soldOut ? 'sold-out' : ''}`}>
        {/* other content */}
      </div>
      ```
