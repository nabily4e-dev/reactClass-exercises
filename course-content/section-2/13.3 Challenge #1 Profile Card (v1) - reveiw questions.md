### 13.2 Challenge #1 Profile Card (v1)

**Q1: What is the goal of the first coding challenge in the React course?**

- **A1:** The goal is to build a developer profile card that includes an avatar image, the developer's name, a short bio, and a list of skills.

**Q2: What are the two options provided for building the project?**

- **A2:** 
  1. Create a new React app on your own computer.
  2. Use the CodeSandbox app to quickly try out the project online.

**Q3: What structure is recommended for the app component in this challenge?**

- **A3:** The structure includes:
  - A `div` with the class name of `card` for the container.
  - An `Avatar` component for the image.
  - A `div` for the data containing an `Intro` component for the heading and bio.
  - A `SkillList` component containing multiple `Skill` components for each skill.

**Q4: How can you upload an image in CodeSandbox for use in your React project?**

- **A4:** You can upload an image by dragging and dropping it into the public folder in CodeSandbox. Then, reference the image in your React component using its filename.

**Q5: How do you pass props to a child component in React?**

- **A5:** Props are passed to a child component by defining them as attributes in the parent component. For example:
  
  ```jsx
  <Skill skill="React" emoji="⚛️" color="blue" />
  ```
  
  The child component receives them as a parameter:
  
  ```jsx
  function Skill(props) {
    return (
      <div className="skill" style={{ backgroundColor: props.color }}>
        <span>{props.skill}</span>
        <span>{props.emoji}</span>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

**Q6: What are the main components required for building the developer profile card?**

- **A6:** The main components are:
  - `Avatar`: Displays the avatar image.
  - `Intro`: Displays the developer's name and bio.
  - `SkillList`: Contains a list of `Skill` components.
  - `Skill`: Displays an individual skill, including the skill name, emoji, and background color.

**Q7: How can you customize each `Skill` component using props?**

- **A7:** By passing props such as `skill`, `emoji`, and `color` to each `Skill` component, you can customize the displayed skill, its emoji, and background color.

**Q8: What is the purpose of the `style` prop in the `Skill` component?**

- **A8:** The `style` prop is used to apply inline CSS styles to the component. In this case, it sets the background color using the value passed through the `color` prop.

**Q9: Why is it important to understand the concept of props in React?**

- **A9:** Understanding props is crucial because they allow components to communicate and share data, enabling the creation of dynamic and customizable UI components.

**Q10: What steps should you follow to build the developer profile card?**

- **A10:**
  1. Set up a new React project either locally or using CodeSandbox.
  2. Create the necessary components (`Avatar`, `Intro`, `SkillList`, `Skill`).
  3. Use the provided CSS for styling.
  4. Pass appropriate props to the `Skill` components to display different skills.
  5. Upload and reference the avatar image correctly.
