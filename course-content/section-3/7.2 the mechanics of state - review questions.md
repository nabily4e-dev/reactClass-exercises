### Review Questions and Answers

**Q: What is the primary way React updates a component's view?**
**A:** React updates a component's view by re-rendering the entire component whenever the underlying state changes.

**Q: How does React handle DOM manipulation?**
**A:** React is declarative, not imperative, meaning we do not manipulate the DOM directly. Instead, React handles the DOM updates for us.

**Q: What happens to a component's state during re-renders?**
**A:** React preserves the component's state throughout re-renders, ensuring the state is not reset unless the component is unmounted.

**Q: How is state typically updated in a React component?**
**A:** State is typically updated using the `useState` hook. The hook provides a state variable and a function to update that state. For example:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

**Q: What triggers a re-render in a React component?**
**A:** A re-render is triggered when the state of the component is updated.

**Q: How does React know to re-render a component when state changes?**
**A:** When the state update function (e.g., `setCount`) is called, React detects the state change and re-renders the component to reflect the updated state.

**Q: What is unmounting in React?**
**A:** Unmounting is when a component is removed from the UI, which resets the component's state.

**Q: Why is React named "React"?**
**A:** React is named "React" because it reacts to state changes by re-rendering the user interface.

**Q: How do you update state based on the current state value?**
**A:** Use a callback function in the `setCount` call to access the current state value:

```javascript
onClick={() => setCount(c => c - 1)}
```

**Q: How do you display a dynamically updated date in React?**
**A:** Create a new `Date` object and manipulate it with `setDate` to add or subtract the `count` value. Convert the date to a readable string format using `toDateString()`:

```javascript
const date = new Date();
date.setDate(date.getDate() + count);
const displayDate = date.toDateString();
```

**Q: How do you conditionally render different messages based on the state value?**
**A:** Use ternary operators to display different messages based on the `count` value:

```javascript
<p>{count > 0 ? 'Positive' : 'Non-positive'}</p>
```
