### 7.4 Creating more components review questions

#### Q1: What is JSX and how is it used in React components?

**A1:** JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML in React components. JSX makes it easier to create React elements because it looks similar to HTML. For instance, we can create a header component with `<h1>` tags directly in the return statement of the component.

#### Q2: How do you create a React component and include it in another component?

**A2:** A React component can be created using a function that returns JSX. For example:

```javascript
function Header() {
  return <h1>Fast React Pizza Company</h1>;
}
```

To include this `Header` component in another component, you use it as a custom HTML tag:

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Q3: What is the `React.createElement` method and how does it differ from JSX?

**A3:** The `React.createElement` method is used to create React elements without using JSX. It requires more code and is less readable. For example, instead of writing `<footer>Currently Open</footer>` in JSX, you would write:

```javascript
React.createElement('footer', null, 'Currently Open');
```

JSX is preferred because it is more concise and easier to read.

#### Q4: How can JavaScript expressions be included within JSX?

**A4:** JavaScript expressions can be included within JSX using curly braces `{}`. For example, to display the current time within JSX, you can use:

```javascript
return <div>Current Time: {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}</div>;
```

#### Q5: What is the purpose of having separate components like Header, Menu, and Footer in a React application?

**A5:** The purpose of having separate components like Header, Menu, and Footer is to create a modular and reusable structure. This approach promotes separation of concerns, making the code easier to maintain, test, and understand. Each component handles a specific part of the user interface.

#### Q6: How are nested components used in a React application?

**A6:** Nested components are used to build complex user interfaces by combining smaller, simpler components. For example, in the given text, the `Menu` component includes multiple `Pizza` components, and the `App` component includes the `Header`, `Menu`, and `Footer` components. This nesting helps organize the application structure:

```javascript
function Menu() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Our Menu</h2>
      <Pizza />
      <Pizza />
      <Pizza />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Q7: Why should each React component return only one root element?

**A7:** Each React component should return only one root element because JSX must be wrapped in a single parent element. This is a requirement to maintain a consistent structure and to avoid rendering issues. If multiple elements need to be returned, they should be wrapped in a `<div>`, `<React.Fragment>`, or any other single container element.

#### Q8: How can you include dynamic content, like the current time, in a React component?

**A8:** Dynamic content can be included in a React component by using JavaScript expressions inside JSX. For instance, to display the current time, you can do:

```javascript
function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer>
      We're currently open. Current time: {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}
    </footer>
  );
}
```

#### Q9: What are the advantages of using JSX over traditional JavaScript for creating elements?

**A9:** JSX offers several advantages over traditional JavaScript for creating elements:

- **Readability:** JSX is more readable and looks like HTML, making it easier for developers to understand the code.
- **Conciseness:** It reduces the amount of code needed to create elements.
- **Integration:** It seamlessly integrates JavaScript expressions and allows embedding logic directly within the markup.

#### Q10: Can React components be defined using function expressions and arrow functions?

**A10:** Yes, React components can be defined using function expressions and arrow functions. For example:

```javascript
const Header = () => {
  return <h1>Fast React Pizza Company</h1>;
};
```

This provides more flexibility in how components are defined, although the function keyword is commonly used.
