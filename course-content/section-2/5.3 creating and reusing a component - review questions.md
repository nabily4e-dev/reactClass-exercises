### 5.2 creating and reusing components review questions

1. **How do you create a new React component using a function?**
   
   - You create a new React component using a function by defining a function that starts with an uppercase letter and returns some markup (usually JSX).
     
     ```javascript
     function Pizza() {
         return <h2>Pizza</h2>;
     }
     ```

2. **What are the two important rules when writing components as functions in React?**
   
   - The function name must start with an uppercase letter.
   - The function must return some markup.

3. **How do you include a new component in an existing React component?**
   
   - You include a new component by calling it inside another componentâ€™s JSX:
     
     ```javascript
     function App() {
         return (
             <div>
                 <Pizza />
             </div>
         );
     }
     ```

4. **What does it mean to nest components in React?**
   
   - Nesting components means using one component inside another. It does not mean declaring one component inside the function body of another component.

5. **What is the significance of component reusability in React?**
   
   - Component reusability allows you to use the same component multiple times within the application, reducing code duplication and making the application more maintainable.

6. **How do you use an image from the public folder in a React component?**
   
   - You reference the image directly in the `src` attribute of an `img` tag:
     
     ```javascript
     function Pizza() {
         return (
             <div>
                 <img src="pizza/spinazzi.jpg" alt="Spinazzi Pizza" />
             </div>
         );
     }
     ```

7. **Why is it important to include an alt attribute in image tags?**
   
   - The alt attribute improves accessibility by providing alternative text for screen readers and also helps with SEO.

8. **What should you do if you want to remove Git-related decorations from the VS Code editor?**
   
   - Go to VS Code settings, search for "diff decorations", and set it to "none".

### Key Points to Remember

- **Creating Components**: Define components as functions with names starting with uppercase letters and ensure they return some markup.
- **Nesting Components**: Use one component inside another without nesting the function declarations.
- **Component Reusability**: Components can be reused multiple times by including them in different parts of the application.
- **Using Images**: Reference images stored in the public folder directly in the JSX using relative paths.
- **Accessibility**: Always include alt attributes in image tags to improve accessibility.
- **VS Code Customization**: Modify VS Code settings to hide Git-related decorations for a cleaner interface if not using GitHub for small projects.
