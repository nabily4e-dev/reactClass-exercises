### 12.1 props_ immutability_ and one-way data flow review questions

### Questions and Answers

**Q1: What are props in React and how are they used?**

- **A1:** Props are used in React to pass data from parent components to child components, enabling communication between them. They are essential for configuring and customizing components.

**Q2: How are props similar to arguments in JavaScript functions?**

- **A2:** Props in React are like arguments passed to regular JavaScript functions. They can accept any type of value, such as single values, arrays, objects, functions, and even other React components.

**Q3: What types of data can be passed as props?**

- **A3:** Any type of value can be passed as props, including strings, numbers, arrays, objects, functions, and React components.

**Q4: What is the difference between props and state in React?**

- **A4:** Props are data passed from parent to child components and are immutable. State is internal data managed within a component, which can be updated by the component itself.

**Q5: Why are props immutable in React?**

- **A5:** Props are immutable to prevent side effects and maintain Reactâ€™s principle of pure functions. This immutability ensures that changes to props do not affect the parent component, maintaining predictable and optimized applications.

**Q6: What is a side effect in the context of React components?**

- **A6:** A side effect occurs when a function changes data outside its scope, such as modifying an object located outside the component function. React components should avoid side effects to maintain pure functions.

**Q7: What is one-way data flow in React, and why is it important?**

- **A7:** One-way data flow means that data in React applications can only pass from parent to child components, never the reverse. This makes applications more predictable, easier to debug, and more efficient compared to two-way data binding used in some other frameworks.

**Q8: How does one-way data flow benefit React applications?**

- **A8:** One-way data flow makes applications more predictable and easier to understand, simplifies debugging, and improves performance by avoiding the complexities and inefficiencies of two-way data binding.

**Q9: Can you pass data from child to parent components in React?**

- **A9:** Yes, while React primarily uses one-way data flow, there are techniques to pass data from child to parent components. This often involves passing functions as props that the child component can call to communicate with the parent.

**Q10: How does React handle data rendering in components?**

- **A10:** React renders a component based on its current data, which includes props and state. The UI is kept in sync with this data, ensuring that any changes in props or state are reflected in the rendered output.
