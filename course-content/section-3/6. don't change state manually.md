### Don't Set State Manually!

In this lesson, we delve into the importance of updating state using React's built-in setter functions rather than attempting manual updates. Understanding why this is crucial for maintaining the integrity and performance of your React applications is key.

#### The Importance of Using Setter Functions

##### Why Not Manual Updates?

In React, state variables should only be updated using the provided setter functions. Let's explore why manual updates are problematic and how they can "break" React.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```javascript
   const [step, setStep] = useState(1);
   ```

2. **Changing to `let`**:
   To illustrate the issue, we change the state variable to `let`:
   ```javascript
   let [step, setStep] = useState(1);
   ```

3. **Manual Update**:
   Attempting to update the state manually:
   ```javascript
   function handleNext() {
     step = step + 1;  // Incorrect approach
   }
   ```

##### What Happens?

- **No Error, No Update**: When you click the button, nothing happens. React doesn't throw an error, but the UI doesn't update either.
- **Why?** React has no way of knowing that the state has been updated. Directly mutating the state variable bypasses React’s internal mechanisms designed to track and manage state changes.

#### React’s Immutability Principle

React emphasizes immutability. When you directly mutate a state variable, React cannot detect the change because:
- **Direct Mutation**: `step = step + 1` directly changes the variable without notifying React.
- **Immutability**: React’s state management relies on immutability to detect and respond to state changes efficiently.

##### Correct Way: Using Setter Functions

1. **Using `setStep`**:
   ```javascript
   function handleNext() {
     setStep(step + 1);  // Correct approach
   }
   ```

2. **Why It Works**:
   - **Functional Update**: `setStep` updates the state in an immutable way, allowing React to re-render the component correctly.
   - **React’s Tracking**: By using `setStep`, React is notified of the state change and can update the component accordingly.

#### Common Pitfall: Objects and Arrays

When dealing with objects or arrays in state, the issue of immutability becomes more complex.

1. **Example with Object**:
   ```javascript
   const [test, setTest] = useState({ name: 'Jonas' });
   ```

2. **Incorrect Manual Update**:
   ```javascript
   function handleNext() {
     test.name = 'Fred';  // Incorrect approach
   }
   ```

##### Observations:
- **Manual Mutation Triggers Re-render**: Surprisingly, this might still trigger a re-render, but it’s bad practice.
- **Why?** Directly mutating objects can lead to unpredictable behavior in complex applications.

##### Correct Way: Updating Objects

1. **Using `setTest`**:
   ```javascript
   function handleNext() {
     setTest({ name: 'Fred' });  // Correct approach
   }
   ```

2. **Why It Works**:
   - **Immutable Update**: Creating a new object and passing it to `setTest` ensures immutability.
   - **Consistent Behavior**: This approach aligns with React’s principles and avoids potential bugs.

#### Critical Terms and Concepts

- **State**: A dynamic piece of data that React components maintain and manage over time.
- **useState**: A React hook for adding state to functional components.
- **Setter Function**: The function returned by `useState` used to update the state.
- **Immutability**: A principle where data is not directly modified but rather replaced with new copies, crucial in React for predictable state management.
- **Re-render**: The process of React updating the UI to reflect changes in state or props.

#### Conclusion

Always use React’s setter functions to update state. This practice ensures immutability, allowing React to efficiently manage and render components. Direct mutations can lead to silent failures or unpredictable behavior, especially in complex applications. Adhering to these principles will lead to more robust and maintainable React applications.
