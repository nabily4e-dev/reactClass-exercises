## Starting a New Project: The Far Away Travel List

### Introduction

In this section, we will build our first interactive project: a travel list application. This project will allow us to learn about creating interactive elements using React. Here are the detailed steps and concepts involved in the process:

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Opening the Command Line Interface (CLI):**

   - **Windows:** Open Command Prompt.
   - **Mac:** Open Terminal.

2. **Navigating to the Desired Directory:**

   - Navigate to the folder where you want to create your project, e.g., Desktop.

3. **Creating a React App:**

   - Run the following command:

     ```bash
     npx create-react-app@5 travel-list
     ```

   - This command will set up a new React application named `travel-list`.

### Overview of the Application

The Far Away Travel List app allows users to create a list of items they need for their trips. Here are the key features:

1. **Adding Items:**

   - Users can add items (e.g., boarding passes) to the list.
   - On adding an item, the statistics section updates.

2. **Deleting Items:**

   - Users can delete items from the list if they are no longer needed.

3. **Marking Items as Packed:**

   - Users can mark items as packed, updating the statistics to reflect the number of packed items.

4. **Sorting Items:**

   - Items can be sorted by input order, description, or packed status.

5. **Clearing the List:**
   - Users can clear the entire list, with a confirmation prompt.

### Application Design and Components

Before writing any code, let's break down the design into components:

1. **Logo:**

   - The top yellow part of the app will be the `Logo` component.

2. **Form:**

   - The form for adding items will be a separate component.

3. **Packing List:**

   - The list of items will be the `PackingList` component.
   - Each item in the list will be an `Item` component (or `PackingItem`).

4. **Statistics:**
   - The section showing the packing statistics will be the `Statistics` component.

### Learning Objectives

In this project, we aim to:

- Work with state management.
- Handle events and form submissions.
- Break down a user interface into reusable components.

### Next Steps

Now that we understand the project structure and objectives, let's move on to implementing the layout. In the next lecture, we will start writing the code to bring this design to life.

### Key Concepts and Terms

- **State Management:** Handling the state of various components and how they interact.
- **Events:** User interactions like clicks and form submissions.
- **Components:** Reusable pieces of the UI.
- **Form Submissions:** Handling user input through forms.
