### Review Questions and Answers

#### Independent State in Component Instances

**Q1: What happens to the state of multiple instances of the same component?**

- **A1**: Each instance of the same component manages its own state independently. Changing the state in one instance does not affect the state in other instances.

**Q2: If three instances of a counter component each have a `score` state initialized to `0`, what happens when the score in one instance is incremented?**

- **A2**: Incrementing the score in one instance only affects that instance. The states of the other instances remain unchanged.

#### State-Driven UI

**Q3: How can we think of the entire UI in a React application?**

- **A3**: The entire UI can be thought of as a function of the state. The UI is always a representation of all the current states in all components.

**Q4: What is the declarative approach in React?**

- **A4**: The declarative approach means describing the UI based on state and letting React handle the rendering. Instead of directly manipulating the DOM, you update the state, and React updates the UI accordingly.

#### Practical Guidelines for Using State

**Q5: When should you create a new state variable in a component?**

- **A5**: You should create a new state variable for any data that a component needs to keep track of over time, especially if it will change in the future.

**Q6: What is a common method for identifying variables that should be state in React?**

- **A6**: Variables that would be defined with `let` or `var` in vanilla JavaScript, or arrays or objects that mutate over the application's lifecycle, should be managed with state in React.

**Q7: Provide an example of using state for a modal window in React.**

- **A7**: For a modal window that can be open or closed, create a state variable `isOpen`:

  ```javascript
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  ```

  - When `isOpen` is `true`, display the window. When `isOpen` is `false`, hide it.

**Q8: How should you think about a component's view in relation to state?**

- **A8**: Always imagine the component's view as a reflection of state changing and evolving over time. This helps in designing dynamic and responsive components.

#### Avoiding Overuse of State

**Q9: What common mistake do beginners often make regarding state in React?**

- **A9**: Beginners often use state for every single variable in a component. This is unnecessary and can cause performance issues due to unnecessary re-renders.

**Q10: When should you avoid using state in a component?**

- **A10**: Avoid using state for variables that should not trigger a re-render. Use regular variables defined with `const` for static data or data that does not change over time.

### Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

**Q11: Why is it important to avoid unnecessary state in a React component?**

- **A11**: Unnecessary state can cause performance issues by triggering unnecessary re-renders, making the application less efficient.

**Q12: How can you ensure your state management practices are efficient?**

- **A12**: Follow these best practices:
  - Only use state for data that changes over time and affects the UI.
  - Use regular variables for static data.
  - Visualize the component's view as a reflection of state changes over time.
