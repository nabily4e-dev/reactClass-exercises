## Conditionally Setting Text and Class Names in React

To achieve the conditional display of text and class names in React, we will use JavaScript and JSX. Let's break down the process step-by-step:

### 1. Conditionally Displaying Text
In our project, we want to display "Sold Out" instead of the price for items that are sold out. To do this, we can use the ternary operator to conditionally set the text inside an element.

### Example:
```jsx
// Assuming pizza is the object with pizza details
const pizza = {
  name: "Margherita",
  price: "$10",
  soldOut: true,
};

// Conditionally setting text
<span>
  {pizza.soldOut ? "SOLD OUT" : pizza.price}
</span>
```

### Explanation:
- We use the ternary operator: `condition ? trueValue : falseValue`.
- If `pizza.soldOut` is `true`, display "SOLD OUT"; otherwise, display `pizza.price`.

### 2. Conditionally Setting Class Names
To change the class name based on whether the pizza is sold out, we again use the ternary operator but within a template literal.

### Example:
```jsx
// Conditionally setting class name
<div className={`pizza ${pizza.soldOut ? "sold-out" : ""}`}>
  <span>
    {pizza.soldOut ? "SOLD OUT" : pizza.price}
  </span>
</div>
```

### Explanation:
- We use a template literal (`` ` ``) to create a string that can embed expressions.
- The ternary operator determines if "sold-out" should be included in the class list.
- If `pizza.soldOut` is `true`, the class list will include "sold-out"; otherwise, it will just be "pizza".

### 3. Implementing in a Component
Let's integrate these into a functional React component.

### Example Component:
```jsx
import React from "react";

const PizzaItem = ({ pizza }) => {
  return (
    <div className={`pizza ${pizza.soldOut ? "sold-out" : ""}`}>
      <h2>{pizza.name}</h2>
      <span>{pizza.soldOut ? "SOLD OUT" : pizza.price}</span>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PizzaItem;
```

### Explanation:
- `PizzaItem` is a functional component that receives a `pizza` object as a prop.
- The `div` element's class name is set conditionally.
- The `span` element's content is set conditionally.

### Common Use Cases:
- **E-commerce Sites**: Displaying "Out of Stock" for unavailable items.
- **User Interfaces**: Showing different messages or styles based on user status (e.g., online/offline).
- **Form Validation**: Displaying validation messages and styling form fields conditionally.

### Summary:
1. Use the ternary operator to conditionally set the text inside elements.
2. Use template literals and the ternary operator to conditionally set class names.
3. Integrate these techniques into React components to create dynamic and responsive UIs.
