### Review Questions and Answers

**Question 1: Why do front-end frameworks like React exist?**

- **Answer**: Front-end frameworks like React exist to simplify the process of building complex web applications by making it easier to keep the user interface (UI) in sync with the underlying data. They help manage the complexities and issues associated with using vanilla JavaScript for large-scale applications.

**Question 2: What is server-side rendering?**

- **Answer**: Server-side rendering is a process where a website is assembled on the server based on data and templates. The resulting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code is sent to the client-side (browser), which then paints it onto the screen.

**Question 3: What is client-side rendering?**

- **Answer**: Client-side rendering is a process where the work of rendering a web page is shifted from the server to the client (browser). In this method, the application consumes data from an API and renders a screen for each view of the application, enabling interactions without reloading the page.

**Question 4: Why was jQuery popular before the rise of front-end frameworks?**

- **Answer**: jQuery was popular because it made JavaScript work consistently across different browsers, simplifying tasks like adding simple dynamics, animations, and hover effects to web pages.

**Question 5: What are single-page applications (SPAs)?**

- **Answer**: Single-page applications are web applications that are rendered on the client side, allowing interactions without reloading the page. They provide a seamless user experience similar to native desktop or mobile applications.

**Question 6: Why is it challenging to build complex front-end applications with vanilla JavaScript?**

- **Answer**: Building complex front-end applications with vanilla JavaScript is challenging because it requires extensive DOM traversing and manipulation, leading to complex, hard-to-maintain code. Additionally, state management becomes difficult, often resulting in _spaghetti code_ and bugs.

**Question 7: What are the two big problems with using vanilla JavaScript for large-scale applications?**

- **Answer**: The two big problems are:

  1. Extensive direct DOM manipulation, leading to complex and hard-to-understand code.
  2. Storing state directly in the DOM, causing many parts of the app to access and change the DOM state directly, introducing bugs and further complexity.

**Question 8: How do front-end frameworks solve these problems?**

- **Answer**: Front-end frameworks solve these problems by providing a structured way to keep the UI in sync with the data, enforcing consistent coding practices, and offering tools for better state management, reducing complexity, maintainability, and the likelihood of bugs.

**Question 9: What is state in the context of a web application?**

- **Answer**: In the context of a web application, state refers to the data that the app depends on and needs to keep in sync with the UI. This includes information like lists of items, search parameters, filter settings, and other dynamic data elements.

**Question 10: What additional benefits do frameworks like React offer to developers?**

- **Answer**: Frameworks like React offer additional benefits such as:

  - Enforcing a consistent and correct way of structuring and writing code.
  - Providing a consistent way of building applications across teams, resulting in more maintainable and cohesive codebases.
  - Handling the hard work of keeping the UI in sync with the data, allowing developers to focus on building the application itself.
