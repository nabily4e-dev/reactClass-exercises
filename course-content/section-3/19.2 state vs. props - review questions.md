### Review Questions and Answers

#### 1. What is state in React?

**Answer:** State is internal data owned and managed by the component in which it is declared. It acts as the component's memory, holding data over time and across multiple re-renders.

#### 2. What is the primary use of state in React components?

**Answer:** State is used to make components interactive by allowing the component to update its own data and trigger re-renders.

#### 3. How does state cause a component to re-render?

**Answer:** When the state is updated within a component, React triggers a re-render of that component to reflect the new state.

#### 4. What are props in React?

**Answer:** Props are external data owned by a parent component and passed down to child components. They act as function parameters, allowing data to flow from parent to child components.

#### 5. How are props similar to function parameters?

**Answer:** Like function parameters, props allow data to be passed from one entity (the parent component) to another (the child component).

#### 6. Can a child component modify the props it receives?

**Answer:** No, props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component that receives them.

#### 7. What happens when a child component receives new or updated props?

**Answer:** When a child component receives new or updated props, React re-renders the child component to ensure it stays in sync with the new data.

#### 8. How are state and props connected when state is passed as a prop?

**Answer:** When a piece of state is passed as a prop, updating the state causes both the component owning the state and the component receiving the prop to re-render.

#### 9. What is the main difference between state and props regarding data ownership?

**Answer:** State is internal data owned by the component in which it is declared, whereas props are external data owned by a parent component and passed to child components.

#### 10. Why are props considered immutable?

**Answer:** Props are considered immutable because the receiving child component cannot change them, ensuring a predictable and unidirectional data flow.

#### 11. In what scenario would both the parent and child components re-render?

**Answer:** Both the parent and child components re-render when a piece of state in the parent is passed as a prop to the child, and that state is updated.

#### 12. How can state be described in terms of component behavior?

**Answer:** State can be described as the component's memory, allowing it to hold and manage data over time and across multiple re-renders, enabling interactivity.

#### 13. What role do props play in configuring child components?

**Answer:** Props allow parent components to configure child components by passing data that acts as settings or initial values for the child components.
