### 2.2 rendering the root component review questions

1. **What is the first step in starting a new React project from scratch?**

   - The first step is to delete unnecessary files and create a new file named `index.js` because Webpack expects the entry point to be called `index.js`.

2. **How do you import React and ReactDOM in a JavaScript file?**

   - You import React and ReactDOM using the ES6 import syntax:

     ```javascript
     import React from 'react';
     import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
     ```

3. **What is the purpose of creating a root element in React?**

   - The root element is where React will render the application. It is selected using `document.getElementById('root')` and is necessary for React to know where to mount the app.

4. **How do you create and render a basic React component?**

   - First, create a function component:

     ```javascript
     function App() {
       return <div>Hello, React!</div>;
     }
     ```

     Then, render it using ReactDOM:

     ```javascript
     const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
     root.render(<App />);
     ```

5. **How did the rendering process change from React 17 to React 18?**

   - In React 17 and earlier, you would render a component like this:

     ```javascript
     ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
     ```

     In React 18, you use the `createRoot` method:

     ```javascript
     const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
     root.render(<App />);
     ```

6. **What is Strict Mode in React and why is it used?**

   - Strict Mode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. It is used during development to help identify unsafe lifecycles, legacy API usage, and unexpected side effects.

     ```javascript
     import React from 'react';
     import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

     function App() {
       return <div>Hello, React!</div>;
     }

     const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
     root.render(
       <React.StrictMode>
         <App />
       </React.StrictMode>
     );
     ```

7. **Why is it important to use Strict Mode during development?**

   - It helps in detecting potential issues early by rendering components twice in development mode to catch unexpected side effects, helps identify unsafe lifecycles, and ensures the app uses the latest React APIs.

### Key Points to Remember

- **File Setup**: Always start with a clean slate by creating `index.js` for Webpack's entry point.
- **Module Import**: Use ES6 syntax for importing React and ReactDOM.
- **Component Creation**: Function components should start with an uppercase letter.
- **Rendering in React 18**: Use `ReactDOM.createRoot` to create and render the root.
- **Strict Mode**: Wrap your app in `React.StrictMode` for better development practices.
