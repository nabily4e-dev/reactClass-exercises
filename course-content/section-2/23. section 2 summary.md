### React Components

**Components:**
- **Definition:** Building blocks of any user interface in React.
- **Self-contained:** Each component includes its own data, JavaScript logic, and appearance.
- **JSX:** Declarative syntax used to write the appearance of components.
- **Return Value:** JSX block returned from each component that describes what the user will see on the screen.

**JSX:**
- **Markup:** Contains HTML-like syntax.
- **CSS:** Included using the `style` prop with a JavaScript object.
- **JavaScript:** Embedded within curly braces `{}`, allowing JavaScript to be written directly inside HTML-like syntax.

**Component Tree:**
- **Hierarchy:** Components are organized in a tree structure.
- **Parent-Child Relationship:** 
  - **Parent Component:** Includes or uses components below it.
  - **Child Component:** Included by a component above it.
- **Example:** `App` component is the parent of `Header`, `Menu`, and `Footer`. `Menu` is the parent of `Pizza` components. `Footer` is the parent of `Order`.

### Props (Properties)
- **Definition:** Mechanism for passing data from parent to child components.
- **Usage:** Define a prop for each value to be passed down.
- **One-Way Data Flow:** Props can only be passed from parent to child, not the other way around.
- **Example:** Rendering different pizzas by creating one `Pizza` component and passing different pizza objects as props.

### Lists and Conditional Rendering

**Creating Lists:**
- **JavaScript Map Method:** Used to loop over an array and render multiple components of the same type.
- **Example:** Rendering a list of pizzas by mapping over a `pizza` array.

**Conditional Rendering:**
- **Purpose:** Render components only when certain conditions are met.
- **JavaScript Tools:** 
  - **And (`&&`) Operator:** Renders component if condition is true.
  - **Ternary Operator (`? :`):** Renders one component if condition is true and another if false.
  - **Multiple Returns:** Different return statements based on conditions.

### Theoretical Concepts

**Imperative vs. Declarative Approaches:**
- **Imperative:** Step-by-step instructions on how to achieve a result.
- **Declarative:** Describes what the UI should look like without specifying how to achieve it (React uses declarative approach).

**Separation of Concerns:**
- **Definition:** Principle of separating a computer program into distinct sections, each addressing a separate concern.
- **In React:** Separating UI into reusable components.

**Mutating Props:**
- **Immutable Props:** Props should not be mutated because they represent a snapshot of data passed from parent to child.
- **State Management:** Use state (not props) for data that changes over time within a component.

### Practical Application
- **Example Project:** Developer profile card.
- **Challenge:** Final coding challenge to finish the developer profile card.
