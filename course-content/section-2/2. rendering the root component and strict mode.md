### Step 1: Setting Up the Project
1. **Delete Unnecessary Files**:
   - Remove all files that are not needed for the project. This gives you a clean slate.
   - Retain only the essential files, particularly `index.html`.

2. **Organize Your Workspace**:
   - Position the browser and the code editor side-by-side for real-time feedback on changes.

### Step 2: Initializing the Project
1. **Create `main.jsx`**:
   - This will be the entry point of your application not the `index.js` file. That is because we are using Vite, the entry point will be named `main.jsx` inside the `src` directory. On the other hand, Webpack, the module bundler, expects this file to be named `index.js` when using `create-react-app` tool. 

2. **Import React Libraries**:
   - Import React and ReactDOM:
     ```javascript
     import React from 'react';
     import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
     ```
   - These libraries are fundamental for building React components and rendering them to the DOM.

### Step 3: Building the First Component
1. **Create the App Component**:
   - Define a function component named `App`:
     ```javascript
     function App() {
       return <div>Hello, React!</div>;
     }
     ```
   - Ensure the component name starts with an uppercase letter, which is a convention in React.

2. **Render the Component to the DOM**:
   - Use `ReactDOM.createRoot` to create a root where your React application will be rendered:
     ```javascript
     const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
     root.render(<App />);
     ```
   - This method attaches the `App` component to a DOM element with the ID `root`.

### Step 4: Comparison with Older Versions of React
1. **Rendering in React 17**:
   - Understand the difference in rendering between React 17 and React 18:
     ```javascript
     // React 17
     ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
     ```

### Step 5: Enabling Strict Mode
1. **Activate Strict Mode**:
   - Wrap the `App` component with `React.StrictMode`:
     ```javascript
     ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
       <React.StrictMode>
         <App />
       </React.StrictMode>
     );
     ```
   - Strict mode helps in identifying potential problems in the application by running checks and warnings during development.

### Summary
- **Start Clean**: Remove unnecessary files for a fresh start.
- **Setup**: Create `main.jsx` and import React and ReactDOM.
- **Create and Render**: Define an `App` component and render it using `ReactDOM.createRoot`.
- **Understand Differences**: Know the changes from older React versions.
- **Enable Strict Mode**: Use `React.StrictMode` for better development practices.

### Key Concepts
- **React Components**: Building blocks of a React application, defined as functions returning JSX.
- **JSX**: JavaScript XML, a syntax extension for writing HTML within JavaScript.
- **ReactDOM**: Library for rendering React components to the DOM.
- **Strict Mode**: A tool for highlighting potential problems in the application.

### Conclusion
By following these steps and understanding the underlying concepts, you can confidently build the Pizza Menu Project from scratch. This approach not only teaches you how to set up a React project but also emphasizes best practices and the importance of modern JavaScript features.
