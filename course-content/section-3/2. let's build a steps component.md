### Steps Component

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. **Setting Up the Project**

- **Create a New Project:**
  - Use Create React App to create a new project. 
  - Command: `npx create-react-app@5 steps`.
  - Navigate to the project folder using the command line.

- **Project Structure:**
  - Clean up the starter files by deleting unnecessary files, keeping `App.js` and `index.js`.

#### 2. **Building the Static Component**

- **Define the Component Structure:**
  - Create the root `App` component in `App.js`.
  - Use a `div` with a class of `steps`.
  - Add child elements for numbers, messages, and buttons.

- **Add Static Elements:**
  - Numbers (`1`, `2`, `3`) inside a `div` with the class `numbers`.
  - A placeholder paragraph for messages with the class `message`.
  - Two buttons (`Previous` and `Next`) inside a `div` with the class `buttons`.

#### 3. **Styling the Component**

- **Apply Styles:**
  - Add inline styles to the buttons using the `style` prop.
  - Colors: Background color (`#7950F2`) and text color (`#FFF`).

#### 4. **Conditional Styling for Steps**

- **Dynamic Class Names:**
  - Use template literals to conditionally apply the `active` class based on the current step.
  - Ensure only the current step is highlighted.

#### 5. **Managing State and Events**

- **Define State Variable:**
  - Use a constant `step` set initially to `1`.
  - This variable will be updated later to navigate through steps.

- **Display Messages Dynamically:**
  - Use a JavaScript object to store step messages.
  - Retrieve the current message based on the `step` value.

#### 6. **Handling Events**

- **Prepare for Event Handling:**
  - The next part of the guide will focus on handling button click events to update the `step` value dynamically.

### Key Concepts and Terminology

- **Create React App:** A CLI tool to create new React projects with a standard setup.
- **State Management:** Managing dynamic data within a component that affects its rendering.
- **Inline Styles:** Applying styles directly to elements using the `style` attribute.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Rendering elements or applying classes based on certain conditions using JavaScript expressions.
- **Event Handling:** Capturing and responding to user actions, such as button clicks, to update the state.

### Detailed Walkthrough

1. **Set Up Project Using Create React App:**
   - Use `npx create-react-app@5 steps` to create the project.
   - Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.

2. **Clean Up Starter Files:**
   - Delete unnecessary files, keeping `App.js` and `index.js`.
   - Open the project in VS Code.

3. **Build Static Component:**
   - Define the `App` component in `App.js`.
   - Add a `div` with class `steps` containing:
     - A `div` with class `numbers` and numbers `1`, `2`, `3`.
     - A paragraph with class `message` as a placeholder.
     - A `div` with class `buttons` containing `Previous` and `Next` buttons.

4. **Style the Buttons:**
   - Add inline styles for background color and text color.

5. **Conditional Class Names:**
   - Use template literals to conditionally apply the `active` class based on the current step.
   - Highlight only the active step.

6. **Manage State and Display Messages:**
   - Define a `step` constant initially set to `1`.
   - Store step messages in a JavaScript object.
   - Display the current message based on the `step` value.

### Preparing for Event Handling

- **Next Steps:**
  - The subsequent part will cover how to handle click events on buttons to update the `step` value dynamically.
  - Learn to make the component interactive by navigating through steps using buttons.

This structured approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of building a simple, interactive React component, focusing on foundational concepts like state management and event handling.
