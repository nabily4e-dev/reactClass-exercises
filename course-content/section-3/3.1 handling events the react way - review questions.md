### Review Questions

1. **What is the difference between imperative and declarative event handling in React?**

   - **Answer:** In imperative event handling, as used in vanilla JavaScript, you manually select DOM elements and attach event listeners using methods like `addEventListener`. In React's declarative approach, you directly associate events with elements using props like `onClick`, making the code more readable and easier to manage.

2. **How do you attach an event listener to an element in React?**

   - **Answer:** You attach an event listener in React by using a prop with a camelCase name corresponding to the event (e.g., `onClick`) and assigning it a function. For example:

     ```jsx
     <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
     ```

3. **Why don't we use `addEventListener` in React?**

   - **Answer:** `addEventListener` is part of the imperative way of building UIs, where you manually handle DOM elements. React uses a declarative approach, making the code cleaner and easier to understand by directly specifying event handlers in the JSX.

4. **What is the correct way to pass a function to an event handler in React?**

   - **Answer:** The correct way is to pass the function reference without parentheses, indicating it should be called only when the event occurs. For example:

     ```jsx
     <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
     ```

     If you use parentheses, the function will be called immediately during the rendering phase.

5. **What happens if you pass a function call instead of a function reference to an event handler?**

   - **Answer:** If you pass a function call (e.g., `onClick={alert('Clicked!')}`), the function executes immediately when the component renders, not when the event occurs. This is because the function is called as soon as React encounters it during the rendering process.

6. **How do you handle events like `onMouseEnter` in React?**

   - **Answer:** Similar to `onClick`, you use the `onMouseEnter` prop and pass a function to it:

     ```jsx
     <button onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}>Hover over me</button>
     ```

7. **Why should you define event handler functions inside the component body?**

   - **Answer:** Defining event handler functions inside the component body is a common practice in React because it keeps the functions close to where they are used, improving readability and maintainability. It also ensures the functions have access to the component's state and props.

8. **What is the naming convention for event handler functions in React?**

   - **Answer:** The naming convention for event handler functions in React is to prefix them with `handle`, followed by the event or action they handle. For example, `handleClick`, `handleMouseEnter`. This convention improves code readability and helps quickly identify event handler functions.

9. **How do you handle multiple events on the same element in React?**

   - **Answer:** You can handle multiple events by assigning different event handler functions to different event props on the same element. For example:

     ```jsx
     <button onClick={handleClick} onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}>
       Click or Hover me
     </button>
     ```

10. **What is a callback function in the context of event handling in React?**

    - **Answer:** A callback function in React event handling is a function that is passed as an argument to an event prop and is executed in response to an event. It is defined without parentheses to ensure it is called only when the event occurs, not during rendering.

11. **Can you provide an example of how to properly define and use an event handler function in React?**

    - **Answer:**

      ```jsx
      function App() {
        const handleClick = () => {
          alert('Button Clicked!');
        };

        return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
      }
      ```

12. **How do you ensure an event handler function does not execute immediately upon rendering in React?**
    - **Answer:** To ensure the function does not execute immediately, pass the function reference without parentheses. For example, use `onClick={handleClick}` instead of `onClick={handleClick()}`.
