V### 8.2 javascript logic in components review question



#### Q1: How can JavaScript logic be included in React components?

**A1:** JavaScript logic can be included in React components by writing it inside the function body of the component. Since components are JavaScript functions, any JavaScript code can be executed within them. This code runs when the component is initialized. For example, you can create variables, perform calculations, and log to the console inside the component.

#### Q2: How do you create and log a variable in a React component?

**A2:** To create and log a variable in a React component, you can define the variable within the component function and use `console.log` to output its value. For example:

```javascript
function App() {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  console.log(hour);
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Q3: How can you display an alert based on a condition in a React component?

**A3:** You can display an alert based on a condition by using an `if-else` statement inside the component function. For example:

```javascript
function App() {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  const openHour = 12;
  const closeHour = 22;

  if (hour >= openHour && hour <= closeHour) {
    alert("We're currently open.");
  } else {
    alert("Sorry, we're closed.");
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

However, using `alert` is not recommended for production as it blocks JavaScript execution.

#### Q4: What is the purpose of using variables like `openHour` and `closeHour` in the component?

**A4:** The variables `openHour` and `closeHour` are used to define the opening and closing hours of the pizzeria. These values are then used in a condition to determine whether the restaurant is open or closed based on the current time.

#### Q5: How can you create a boolean variable to check if the restaurant is open or closed?

**A5:** You can create a boolean variable to check if the restaurant is open or closed by using a condition and assigning the result to the variable. For example:

```javascript
function App() {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  const openHour = 12;
  const closeHour = 22;

  const isOpen = hour >= openHour && hour <= closeHour;
  console.log(isOpen); // Logs true if open, false if closed

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Q6: Why does the alert show up twice in strict mode?

**A6:** The alert shows up twice in strict mode because React's strict mode renders components twice to help identify side effects and ensure components are pure. This is a development feature to assist with debugging.

#### Q7: What is a better approach than using `alert` in a React component for indicating open or closed status?

**A7:** A better approach than using `alert` is to set a variable and use it in the JSX to conditionally render content. For example:

```javascript
function App() {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  const openHour = 12;
  const closeHour = 22;

  const isOpen = hour >= openHour && hour <= closeHour;

  return (
    <div>
      {isOpen ? "We're currently open." : "Sorry, we're closed."}
      {/* Other JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This approach avoids blocking JavaScript execution and integrates better with the React rendering process.

#### Q8: How do you combine JavaScript logic and JSX to display dynamic content in a React component?

**A8:** You combine JavaScript logic and JSX by using curly braces `{}` to include JavaScript expressions within JSX. For example, to display a message based on the `isOpen` variable:

```javascript
function App() {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  const openHour = 12;
  const closeHour = 22;

  const isOpen = hour >= openHour && hour <= closeHour;

  return (
    <div>
      {isOpen ? "We're currently open." : "Sorry, we're closed."}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Q9: How can you comment out JavaScript code in a React component?

**A9:** You can comment out JavaScript code in a React component using `//` for single-line comments or `/* */` for multi-line comments. For example:

```javascript
function App() {
  // const hour = new Date().getHours();
  // const openHour = 12;
  // const closeHour = 22;

  // const isOpen = hour >= openHour && hour <= closeHour;
  // console.log(isOpen);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* {isOpen ? "We're currently open." : "Sorry, we're closed."} */}
      {/* Other JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Q10: How can you handle conditional rendering based on the current time in a React component?

**A10:** You can handle conditional rendering based on the current time by defining a condition and using it to render different JSX. For example:

```javascript
function App() {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  const openHour = 12;
  const closeHour = 22;

  const isOpen = hour >= openHour && hour <= closeHour;

  return (
    <div>
      {isOpen ? "We're currently open." : "Sorry, we're closed."}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This method ensures that the correct message is displayed based on whether the current time falls within the open hours.
