### 10.1 styling react applications review questions

#### Q1: How does React handle CSS styling for components?

**A1:** React allows multiple ways to style components, including inline styles, external CSS or Sass files, CSS modules, styled components, and utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS. React itself does not enforce any particular method, giving developers flexibility in how they choose to style their components.

#### Q2: What is inline styling and how is it implemented in React?

**A2:** Inline styling in React is implemented using a JavaScript object. Instead of writing styles as a string (like in HTML), you define them as an object where the properties are in camelCase. For example:

```javascript
const style = {
  color: 'red',
  fontSize: '32px',
};

return <h1 style={style}>Hello World</h1>;
```

You can also directly write the style object within the JSX element using double curly braces:

```javascript
return <h1 style={{ color: 'red', fontSize: '32px' }}>Hello World</h1>;
```

#### Q3: Why does React use `className` instead of `class` for applying CSS classes?

**A3:** React uses `className` instead of `class` because `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. Using `className` avoids conflicts and maintains the JSX syntax consistent with JavaScript.

#### Q4: How do you import and apply external CSS files in a React application?

**A4:** To import and apply external CSS files in a React application, you use the `import` statement at the top of your JavaScript file. For example:

```javascript
import './index.css';
```

Then, you apply the styles using the `className` attribute in JSX:

```javascript
return <div className="container">Content</div>;
```

#### Q5: What is the purpose of Webpack in handling CSS in React applications?

**A5:** Webpack handles CSS in React applications by bundling the CSS files and injecting them into the application. When you import a CSS file in a React component, Webpack processes and includes the styles in the final bundle, ensuring they are applied globally or scoped as needed.

#### Q6: What are the benefits of using external CSS files compared to inline styles?

**A6:** The benefits of using external CSS files compared to inline styles include:

- **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps the styling separate from the component logic.
- **Reusability:** Styles defined in external files can be reused across multiple components.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to manage and update styles in a centralized location.
- **Performance:** External stylesheets can be cached by browsers, improving load times.

#### Q7: What are global styles in the context of a React application?

**A7:** Global styles are CSS styles defined in an external CSS file and imported into the React application. These styles are applied globally to all components that match the selectors, meaning any component with a matching class or element will inherit these styles.

#### Q8: How can you apply styles conditionally in React components?

**A8:** You can apply styles conditionally in React components using JavaScript logic to determine the class or style to apply. For example:

```javascript
const isPrimary = true;
return (
  <div className={isPrimary ? 'primary' : 'secondary'}>
    Conditional Styling
  </div>
);
```

#### Q9: Why might inline styles get out of hand in larger applications?

**A9:** Inline styles can get out of hand in larger applications because they require defining a JavaScript object for each component's styles. This can lead to repetitive code, difficulties in maintaining consistency, and increased complexity as the application grows.

#### Q10: What are styled components and how do they differ from traditional CSS in React?

**A10:** Styled components are a way to define component-level styles in a React application using tagged template literals in JavaScript. They differ from traditional CSS by scoping styles to the component, preventing style leakage and improving maintainability. Styled components allow for dynamic styling and theming directly within the component file. Example:

```javascript
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
  background: blue;
  color: white;
  font-size: 16px;
`;

return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
```

### Summary

React offers various methods to style components, including inline styles, external CSS files, CSS modules, and styled components. While React does not enforce a specific styling approach, it supports flexibility in how styles are applied. Inline styles use JavaScript objects, while external CSS files are imported and applied using `className`. Webpack handles the bundling and injection of CSS into the application. Styled components provide a modern approach by scoping styles to individual components, enhancing modularity and maintainability.
